## **2.1 Overview**

In this chapter, you will be introduced to several ggplot2 extensions for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,

-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,

-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.

## **2.2 Getting started**

### **2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries**

In this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.

-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.

-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

Code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, ggthemes, hrbrthemes, tidyverse)
```

### **2.2.2 Importing data**

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.

The code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

There are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame.

Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.

-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

## **2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel**

One of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = ID), 
             hjust = .5, 
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

[**ggrepel**](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap02/img/image3.jpg){width="52"} is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text as in our examples on the right.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap02/img/image2.jpg)

We simply replace `geom_text()`  by  [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()`  by  [`geom_label_repel`](#0).

### **2.3.1 Working with ggrepel**

```{r}

ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS, 
           y=ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              linewidth=0.5) +  
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), 
                   fontface = "bold") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

## **2.4 Beyond ggplot2 Themes**

ggplot2 comes with eight [built-in themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html), they are: `theme_gray()`, `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()`, `theme_linedraw()`, `theme_minimal()`, and `theme_void()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  theme_gray() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") 
```

Refer to this [link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#themes) to learn more about ggplot2 `Themes`

### **2.4.1 Working with ggtheme package**

[**ggthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/index.html) provides [‘ggplot2’ themes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, [Fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail), ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.pinterest.com/wsjgraphics/wsj-graphics/), among others.

In the example below, *The Economist* theme is used

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_economist()
```

It also provides some extra geoms and scales for ‘ggplot2’. Consult [this vignette](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) to learn more.

### **2.4.2 Working with hrbthems package**

[**hrbrthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrbrthemes/index.html) package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_ipsum()

```

The second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used. Consult [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hrbrthemes/vignettes/why_hrbrthemes.html) to learn more.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,
              base_size = 15,
              grid = "Y")
```

**\
What can we learn from the code chunk above?**

-   `axis_title_size` argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,

-   `base_size` argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and

-   `grid` argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.
