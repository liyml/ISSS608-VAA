The amount of damage and recovery time depends\n\nAccording to recent studies, there is a concerning rise in number of heart issues among adults, with reports showing a significant increase in heart attack and cardiovascular disease rates in people under 40, largely attributed to unhealthy lifestyle factors like poor diet, lack of exerciose and smoking.\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to use appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis Methods and tidyverse family package to process the data, and the statistical graphics were prepared using ggplot2 and its extension.\n\nThe Dataset\n\nThe dataset offer a depth exploration of heart attack incidents in Japan, focusing on the differences between youth and adult age groups, it provide valuable insight into the health profiles, risk factors and potential triggers associated with heart attack s among female and male.\n\nGetting Started\n\nSetting and Analytical tools\n\nThe following R packages were used in this Take-Home exercise:\n\n-   [**haven**](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) for importing SAS files;\n\n-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (i.e. readr, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2) for performing data science tasks such as importing, tidying, and wrangling data, as well as creating graphics based on The Grammar of Graphics;\n\n-   [**reshape2**](https://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape/) for transforming data between wide and long formats;\n\n-   [**ggthemr**](https://www.shanelynn.ie/themes-and-colours-for-r-ggplots-with-ggthemr/) for aesthetic themes created by user, Ciarán Tobin;\n\n-   [**ggridges**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html) for creating ridgeline plots;\n\n-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) for visualising distributions and uncertainty; and\n\n-   [**ggpubr**](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/) for creating publication ready ggplot2 plots.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(haven, tidyverse, reshape2, ggthemr, ggridges, ggdist, ggpubr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nImporting data\n\nThe data set used in this exercise is\n\nThe data is imported as\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_attack_Jpn <- read_csv(\"data/japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nData Preparation\n\nCheck for Duplicate\n\nCheck and handle the missing value\n\nVariable selection\n",
